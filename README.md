You can entirely customize anything you want, but there are some important things you always have to keep.

1) Behind the title name, it has to be a subtitle saying "Made with the GoDance Engine" that is visible enough to be readable for the user.
2) You have to put this in the title screen: "This fangame uses the "GoDance Engine" made by WiiUGamerJ available at GitHub"
